Published in: 'GRF'

Description: 'Estimation of effective weights alpha_i(x_1, x_2) for the infeasable observations theta_tilde. The effective weights are computed by a regression forest on n=500, 1000, 2000 observations x_i = (-0.5 + i/n, u_i), with u_i~U(-0.5, 0.5)  and target variable Y_i=theta(x_i) + eps_i, for a given theta function, here triangle function theta(x) = max(0, 1 - |x_1|/0.2), with Gaussian noise eps_i with mean zero and standard deviation of 0 and 0.1.'

Keywords: 'RF, GRF, infeasable function, estimation, effective weights, bandwidth'
